# Clinical Pharmacist Intervention

Clinical pharmacists work directly with physicians, other health professionals, and patients to ensure that the medications prescribed for patients 
contribute to the best possible health outcomes. Clinical pharmacists can adjust the treatment plan of the diagnosed doctor after the doctor approves
his suggestions. So, the main goal of the suggested project is to facilitate the process  of recommendation and following up cost reduction of it.
